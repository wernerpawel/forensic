Over 200 locations in the file system and registry allow autostarts to be configured on x64 versions of Windows. These locations are often referred to as Autostart Extensibility Points, or ASEPs.
ASEPs have legitimate and valuable purposes. For example, if you want your instant messaging contacts to know when you are online, having the messaging client start when you log on is a great help. Users enjoy search toolbars and PDF readers that become part of Internet Explorer. And much of Windows itself is implemented through ASEPs in the form of drivers, services, and Explorer extensions.
